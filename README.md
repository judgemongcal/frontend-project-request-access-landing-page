## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements
- Receive an error message when the form is submitted if:
  - The `Email address` field is empty should show "Oops! Please add your email"
  - The email is not formatted correctly should show "Oops! Please check your email"

## My process

My process started with coding all the HTML elements necessary for this project one by one, and styling them with CSS to allow myself to focus on completing one area of the design before I move on with the next one (divide and conquer approach). This structure is also applied in writing CSS, to allow for other people to easily navigate the code. After the HTML and CSS is set, I then proceeded with adding the email verification function via JS. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Responsive Design


### What I learned

There's value in gaining some decent level of mastery on CSS before proceeding with frameworks. You can do a lot with plain CSS if you just know how to use it and all of the properties it provides. In terms of JS, it requires an anchor point or any way to target a specific element that you want to get/change. 

### Continued development

I'll be focusing more on projects that require more JS than my previous projects, and I will be going after projects that require more complicated CSS or a framework.
